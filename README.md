# Hashtag-Prediction
Description: This project uses NLP models to classify tweets as one of the following four hashtags: #crpyto, #thanksgiving, #lockdown, and #dogs. About 160,000 tweets from these four hashtags were collected. After filtering out tweets that were retweets, quoted tweets, or non-English tweets, about 45,000 tweets were left. In order to predict what hashtag a tweet belonged to various models were created, including two baseline models (logisitic regression and Naive Bayes), as well as neural network models which involved different word embeddings and structures. To evaluate the models, F1 scores were computed, in addition to other measurements and figures which can be found in the report and code.
